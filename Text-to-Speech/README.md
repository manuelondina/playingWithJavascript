Please create your own Account in AWS and add the keys to the code as it says in the code,remember to add Full Access to AWS Polly Service in the user. Also have in mind the region you are using and the voice availabilty, for this example we are using us-west-2 and neural engine voices. 

To Summarize:
1. Create an AWS Account
2. Create an User in IAM Console Management (You can do this by typing IAM in search within AWS platform)
3. Add full acccess to AWS Polly to that user
4. In the code put the correct keys and region as is requested from line 6 to 8.(you can use same region as mentioned above)
